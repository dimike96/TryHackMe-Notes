# My TryHackMe Notes Repository

This will serve to catalog my experience going through TryHackMe rooms as part of my journey learning about cyber-security and information technology. 

If it's helpful to anyone else's jouney that's great! I am focusing on the **free** rooms, and I have some directly copy-pasted segments from these rooms in my notes. 

The rooms are all linked directly at the top of each rooms note doc and all credit for the material goes to the respective room authors!

*Note: I have used a mix of Obsidian, and MarkText to make these and occasionally the formatting gets wacky (especially code-blocks). I will try to stay on top of it in case for some reason I'm not the only one who references these!*
