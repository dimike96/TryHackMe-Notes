---

List of free rooms: https://sm4rty.medium.com/free-350-tryhackme-rooms-f3b7b2954b8d

*Some of those have been made private or unavailable so this is just ones I have verified are still open as of (06/22). You can search for free rooms on the site but I wanted an easier list of rooms grouped by learning area.*
